<exercise id="2" title="Let's Wrangle Some Weather Data!">

Below is the code to get weather data from Edmonton from 1901 to 2016. The latitude and longitude of Edmonton are **53.544388** and **-113.490929**, we could change those to different values in the url to get weather data about another location.

<codeblock id="01_01">

</codeblock>

Hint: Press the `Run Code` button. Be patient, once it loads you should see a data table that is `[1392 rows x 5 columns]` in size.

Hint: Try changing the city to Toronto by changing the values for latitute and longitude to **43.651890** and **-79.381706** and running the code again.
