<exercise id="1" title="Where It Begins">

Hello. We need your help to settle an argument. One of the Grade 3 teachers insists that June has nicer weather than August, so we should change the school calendar to have time off in June and go back in August.
Can you use data science to solve this argument?

</exercise>

<exercise id="2" title="The Data">

The first thing we need to do to solve this argument is to find some weather data. We'll use data from **Edmonton, Alberta**, in this case because that's where the teacher is from. In our course we'll also show you how you can get weather data from other places in Canada, or the world.

Historical weather data sets are available from the [Canadian Centre for Climate Services](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/canadian-centre-climate-services.html).

We can use an online data science platform called Jupyter notebooks to run code, create visualizations, and write about what we find. To log in to a free server that runs Jupyter notebooks, all you need in order to access it is a Google or Microsoft account. (We'll do this later.)
