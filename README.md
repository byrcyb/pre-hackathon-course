# Welcome to **[a Callysto Hackathon on Sustaining Mars](http://bit.ly/callystosustainingmarshackathon)**! ðŸš€ This course is hosted [here]().

This course source repository provides [Callysto](https://callysto.ca/) hackathon participants details on:

- Pre-hackathon activities.
- Getting help.
- Hackathon challenges.

The interactive course site is built from the python course template created by [Ines Montani](https://ines.io/), originally built for her [spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io).  The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the
back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org).
